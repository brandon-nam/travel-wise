I guess you're not misreading\u2014it really is 20 locations in 3 weeks. \\^\\^'\n\nThe first exclusion I'd consider is dropping Shimonoseki and spending more time in Kagoshima. Another option would be skipping Matsumoto, which would give us more time in Fujikawaguchiko or Hakone.\n\nAlternatively, removing the entire Kyushu or Alps portion would make the trip more relaxed. However, while my girlfriend and I will probably visit Japan again, the third person may not have the chance anytime soon, so it feels somewhat justified to push the itinerary a bit more.\n\nWhat would you drop from the schedule to make it more manageable?",

If so, you've purchased plane tickets already, I assume.\n\n\n>What would you drop from the schedule to make it more manageable?\n\n\n22 nights is a really great amount of time to have in Japan. You have a ton of flexibility, but I would drop enough cities that it would look like a totally different itinerary.\n\n\nSince you mentioned Yakushima and that's my favorite non-Tokyo location in Japan, I'd recommend 3-4 nights. You'll want to rent a car, though. If you went with that, and based off the cities you do have on there, I'd recommend something like:\n\n\n7\u00a0nights Tokyo (1-2 day trips)\n\n6 nights Kyoto/Osaka (1-2 day trips)\n\n2-3 nights Fukuoka\n\n3-4 nights Yakushima\n\n\nThese four locations are actually very convenient to group together, as you can get direct flights to/from Yakushima via both Fukuoka and Osaka.\n\n\nThis would leave you with 2-4 nites to play with. You could add in Hiroshima/Miyajima or somewhere else or an extra day in Tokyo or Kyoto/Osaka if you wanted to do another day trip.\u00a0\n\n\nI'd try to get all of Tokyo on the backend, if possible. In the past, my wife and I arrive in Tokyo very early, stay in the airport, and catch a flight to Fukuoka. Stay there a couple nights, then fly to Yakushima for 4 nights, then off to wherever.\n\n\nJust some ideas to ruminate on.",

Not sure if you mean sento, or public baths, instead of onsen. There's not much onsen available at Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, which is why people travel out to visit onsen towns. The closest and easiest onsen you can travel to in Kansai is Arima Onsen at Kobe.\n\n3. No. No. They'd have towel rentals if you're doing day trips. You don't wear swimsuits into the onsen. You'd have to get comfortable doing so in your birthday suit.\n\n4. If you can, why not? Skips the queue and some may be cheaper if purchased online.\n\n7.
