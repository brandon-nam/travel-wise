Anyone have tips for a solo first-timer?

You'd only need about 3\\~4 hours if you're with a guide (you can search for free volunteer guides for Himeji Castle, but please apply only if you're really interested about its history), probably shorter if you're just checking out the castle on your own (cleared it in 2hrs the first time I went there). I normally combine it with a trip to Miyajima (or Hiroshima) because I might as well just do the Shinkansen trip once, but that may be quite high tempo for you. You can also consider making a quick stop at Kobe, or just go back to Osaka and check out Den Den town earlier, or visit some other places. Make sure you get the Kansai-Hiroshima Pass as it will easily pays itself out.\n\nD5. Osaka castle is going to be disappointing after visiting Himeji Castle.\n\nD7. Onsen in Kyoto? Where? Just curious. Kyoto's not particularly well known for onsen.\n\nD8. Bamboo groves are ok to visit it you manage your expectations. Majority of the tourists crowd the entrance and the short distance after it, so it you walk all the way to the end, it's possible to get good pictures with few people in it. Sagano Scenic Railway on the other hand is a trap in my opinion, and only worth it during sakura season or autumn peaks. Avoid it otherwise.\n\nD9. You don't need a full day at Fushimi Inari Taisha. Go there early (7+ is good for a relatively quiet experience), go as high as you want, then maybe visit Uji after. It's along the same train track.\n\nI'm personally a huge fan of onsen towns, and it's always a highlight of my trip to visit one. You can considering visiting at least one as it serves as a good rest day. There's always the typical Hakone that you can consider, but there are other options like Kinosaki or Arima. Or if you're are more adventurous, you can go to other lesser visited ones.",

Tokyo Disneyland and TeamLab on the same day could be particularly draining. While the plan covers a lot of great places, it\u2019s important to remember that travel costs (especially for Shinkansen) and energy can add up quickly.
