Are there English signs in airports?\n\n2. Do we need cash to purchase IC cards or can we pay by card? (We have android phones so need physical cards) \n\n3. How much yen should we get out of the atm on arrival? There are 4 of us but we'll use credit cards for payments whenever possible on our trip.\n\n4. We are planning to collect eki stamps in our stamp books, and have read that other places of significance also sometimes have them, not just trains.

During my time in Osaka, I wanted to take a day trip to Hiroshima to check out the Atomic Dome, go another day really early in the morning to check out Himeji Castle and maybe check out Kobe on the way back, unless you guys have suggestions.
