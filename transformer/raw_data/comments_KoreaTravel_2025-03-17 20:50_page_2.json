Here's the [Embassy of Korea page for the US](https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/us-en/brd/m_4503/view.do?seq=713251) on nationality that I found. But this [Embassy of Korea page for Switzerland](https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/ch-en/brd/m_20340/view.do?seq=32&page=1) is a lot more clear and digestible.\n\nFirst, you should find out if your parents have registered your birth with the Korean consulate or not. As far as I know, if you're on file, even a short trip has the potential to flag something at immigration control (since you're supposed to enter and exit Korea with a Korean passport as a dual citizen).",
