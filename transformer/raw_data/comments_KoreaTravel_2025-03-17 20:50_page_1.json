        "body": "Hi travelling to Seoul from March 30th to April 3 for cherry blossom season. We will hit up all the usual cherry blossom spots in Seoul like Yeouido, Seokchon Lake, Seoul Forest etc.\n\nBUT one of the days we're planning to head to Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival on April 1st from Seoul.\n\nHad a few questions:  \n  \nFor those that have done the trip in one day is it really hectic timing wise?\n\nFrom my research it seems like it takes 3 hours if we take the KTX from Seoul Station to Changwon-Jungang (2.5 hours) then a taxi (20 mins) to Jinhae. Is this the quickest way?\n\nThe train schedule looks a bit funny because I see the first train is 8:23am but the train before that is 5:03am or 5:38am? Nothing in between?\n\nWe will be staying at the Grand Hyatt in Seoul so we are  only 7 mins away from Seoul Station via taxi.\n\nMy thinking is in Jinhae I would like to 'try' to do all 3 things:\n\n\\- Short hike to Jangboksan  \n\\- Walk the Dream Road (I read I can reach that via the hike)  \n\\- Visit the cherry blossom festival\n\nI keep hearing that if we do it in a single day it will feel very rushed but mathematically in my head I imagine:\n\n8:23am early train from Seoul Station for Changwonjungang (but if can leave 6:30/7:00am even better)  \n11:17am reach Jinhae\n\n\\- Hike maybe 2-3 hours + walk Dream Road  \n\\- Visit cherry blossom festival + snack on some food for say 2-3 hours max\n\nSo technically we'll be done say latest by 5pm-ish and take the 6:14pm train and be back in Seoul by 9pm-ish. If we can take an earlier 6:30/7:00am train then maybe we can even be back by 7pm-ish.\n\nDoes this sound like a fair and realistic plan?",
