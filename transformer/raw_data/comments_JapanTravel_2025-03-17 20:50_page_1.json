Are there English signs in airports?\n\n2. Do we need cash to purchase IC cards or can we pay by card? (We have android phones so need physical cards) \n\n3. How much yen should we get out of the atm on arrival? There are 4 of us but we'll use credit cards for payments whenever possible on our trip.\n\n4. We are planning to collect eki stamps in our stamp books, and have read that other places of significance also sometimes have them, not just trains.

Sleep in Takahara.\n* Day 2: Takahara -(bus)-> Hosshinmon -(walk)-> Yunomine. Sleep in Yunomine.\n* Day 3: Walk to Hongu, and around Yunomine area (Dainichi-goe). Sleep in Hongu Taisha.\n* Day 4: Hongu Taisha -(bus)-> Koguchi -(walk)-> Nachi Taisha -(bus)-> Katsuura\n\n  \nA third option would be to sleep in Nachisan and not in Katsuura, but I've read that accommodation is much better in Katsuura, and that the city itself is nice to spend a night.\n\nAny thoughts on which plan sounds better or if there\u2019s another option I\u2019m not considering?
