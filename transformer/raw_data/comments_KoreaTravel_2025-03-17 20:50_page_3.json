A while back, there was some discussion about what happens at age 23; is the Korean Citizenship automatically lost or does Korea need to serve the individual with a choice of nationality form and then if no action is taken the Korean Citizenship is lost.  I'm not 100% sure which it is, although my assumption has been they won't let someone keep dual if they miss the deadline (they may let them keep Korean Citizenship if they renounce the foreign citizenship).\n\nAnyways, once your loss of nationality is recorded, you can also apply for a F-4 visa.  This will give you residency/work rights in Korea (if you ever want them).",

I need a visa to study in Korea, so I currently going through the process of registering my birth, renouncing my Korean citizenship, then applying for the visa. \n\nAlso, like you mentioned, I'm looking into getting the F-4 visa as that allows me a lot more flexibility.\n\nAre you yourself a dual citizen?

I had a feeling this was the case, as especially with the males it allows them to prosecute claims if the person comes back to Korea (from Korea's standpoint, it is much better that the person is still a Korean Citizen vs. them calling their embassy claiming they are being harassed).\n\nI also know where you are stuck.  To obtain a longer-term visa, they will want to see the birth certificate and understand whether anyone is in fact a Korean National (who are the parents and what was their nationality/status at the time of birth).\n\nAnyways, good news is that the F-4 should be easy to obtain once you finish the current process.  Although that doesn't help if you are trying to get a visa for the fall(?).\n\nBest of luck, hope it is sorted out soon.",
