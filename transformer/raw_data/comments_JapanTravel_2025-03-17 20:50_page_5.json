Cut by half, leave a bit of slack, and visit an additional spot if you have time.\n\nDay 1, you won't have enough time to see all that except if you run through each location.\n\nDay 2, you're thinking of a -daytrip- ? that's technically possible, but you'll rush once there and spend half of the day aboard trains, boats or ropeways\n\nDay 3 is almost doable, if you plan properly (Hijiri is not in Akihabara for instance)\n\nDay 4 ... if you don't see any museum in Ueno, maybe...\n\nDay 5 : I am guessing that's a typo and you meant Osaka castle. You're planning to go to Nara (which itself is worth several days, so I am guessing only a couple super touristy spots ?), then Osaka castle, then Dotonbori ? that's too much.\n\nDay 6 : same, quite packed, you'll need to rush through things.\n\nDay 7 : maybe doable if you start early\n\nDay 8 : most of the shops in Jinbocho open at 10, that leaves very much time to visit some shops AND go to a palace tour. Well there are only 2 possible times, 10am and 1:30pm, they last 1h30, so it's going to be very complicated...\n\nTLDR : too much",
