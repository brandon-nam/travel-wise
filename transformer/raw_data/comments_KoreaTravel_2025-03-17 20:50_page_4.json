Traffic was a bit jammed, definitely noisy but overall the protest was very controlled and mainly during the day (when we were not in our hotel rooms). They rope off the protest area clearly so there will unlikely be a situation where you can't leave your hotel due to the protests. The worst situation is once you leave your hotel you will need to immediately turn left or right because the new roped off section restricts your area outside your hotel a little. \n\nI don't think this should be a major concern.",

        "body": "Just now leaving Korea after 7days of vacation. \n\nExperienced protests twice in 5 days in Seoul, mostly near Gwanghwamun. They are setup around the palace during the day but they are off to the side of the road and do not cause any inconvenience aside from their tents and banners maybe disrupting tourists taking photos of the King statue from Gwanghwamun gate. If you are going in the palace through the gate, you will see them behind you but they won't show in your photos. They have speakers playing some protest stuff but it isn't loud. Some people stand around Gwanghwamun square with speakers but I'm not sure if they are protesting or marketing some religion or selling stuff. Locals act indifferent to all of it, focusing more on their phones when not walking, so I assume it's all part of their daily routine. Police are scattered around the protest area but it's not so concentrated that you will feel uncomfortable. I've experienced more chaos in Myeongdong-gil, the tourist shops street. \n\nThis was our experience from noon to late afternoon on our schedule for Gwanghwamun. From what I've heard, more people showed up later that night but by 9pm everything was quiet. I saw your hotel from the streets, its not going to be affected. \n\nThe next day we were on the opposite side of the city the whole day with no clue what was going on at the square. After a long day, we decided to ride the bus back to our hotel only to find traffic on the main road leading to gwanghwamun. We just caught the start of the protest march around 7pm. All routes that went along the path of the protest had heavy traffic but the flow was controlled by the authorities. Luckily the bus route we took turned off the main road quickly. Had we taken the subway, we wouldn't have known there was a march. It was more like a parade really with how it was very well organized. It happened around the time of people going home from work so there were more people in the local street food stands. \n\nThis happened on March, I'm pretty sure any \"protest\" in April will mostly be the same. All in all, don't let the protests desuade you from your plans.",
