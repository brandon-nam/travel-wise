Or should  I stop and stay somewhere small between Kyoto and Tokyo?\n\nIs Asakusa a good place to stay in Tokyo, I don't mind a bit of travel and would prefer a bit quieter if there is a further out option.\n\n  \nThanks Tomadachis!",

It's hard to search for it blindly when it probably has some special name. I've found the 'Kansai Area Pass' on JR official site but I'm quite confused because the site attempts to use professional english but it's poorly translated, so I'm not sure if it's something we can just buy and use",
