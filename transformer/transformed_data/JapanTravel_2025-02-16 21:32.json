I\u2019ve been to Tokyo and Kyoto before, so I haven\u2019t fully planned those yet, but I wanted to get this part locked in first.\n\nI like a mix of nature, history, and unique local experiences. I also prefer traveling by public transport and won\u2019t be renting a car. Would love any advice on whether this plan makes sense, if I should tweak the pacing, or if there are any hidden gems I shouldn\u2019t miss!\n\n# Kyushu Itinerary\n\n**April 23 (Tue) \u2013 Travel Day**\n\n* Flying into Tokyo and heading straight to Kagoshima in the evening. Just a transit stop before heading to Yakushima.\n\n**April 24 (Wed) \u2013 Yakushima**\n\n* Taking the first ferry to Yakushima, dropping off my stuff, and starting to explore.\n\n**April 25\u201327 (Thu\u2013Sat) \u2013 Yakushima**\n\n* Three full days on the island for hiking, nature, and exploring. Planning to leave on the last ferry on the 27th to head to Kumamoto.\n\n**April 28\u201329 (Sun\u2013Mon) \u2013 Kumamoto**\n\n* Two days to explore Kumamoto. Might take a day trip somewhere nearby\u2014still deciding.\n\n**April 30 (Tue) \u2013 Arita**\n\n* Heading to Arita for the annual pottery fair. Staying overnight.\n\n**May 1\u20133 (Wed\u2013Fri) \u2013 Nagasaki**\n\n* Three days in Nagasaki, with at least one day trip (maybe Gunkanjima or Shimabara).\n\n**May 4\u20135 (Sat\u2013Sun) \u2013 Yamaguchi**\n\n* Planning a day trip to Hagi and another TBD day around Yamaguchi.\n\n**May 6\u20138 (Mon\u2013Wed) \u2013 Fukuyama / Okayama Area**\n\n* Still figuring out specifics, but thinking about places like Onomichi or Kurashiki.\n\nAfter this, I\u2019ll be heading to Kyoto and Tokyo before flying home.\n\nDoes this look like a solid plan? Anything I should change or add? Appreciate any tips!",

I just have some questions that I would really appreciate some answers for:\n\n1. Is GALA Yuzawa the best place to go for someone who doesn't plan to ski/snowboard? Or would another resort be better? I've also seen Yuzawa Kogen and NASPA Ski Garden as alternatives but GALA Yuzawa seemed to be more popular, even among non-ski goers online\n2. Are there other activities to do besides the ski resorts in Yuzawa? I'm aware of the Sake Museum at Echigo-Yuzawa station and have plans to do this as well during the day, possibly in the afternoon\n3. Has anyone experienced Sake Bath Yunosawa and was it good? I have tattoos so I can't go to most public baths/onsens (my currently booked accoms has private onsen reservations -- it's why I decided to book one night there). But, if the experience at Sake Bath Yunosawa is good, then I will really reconsider my one night stay\n4. After my initial research, I saw that Karuizawa was another place that's recommended for a day-trip snow experience. Does it make for a better day trip than Yuzawa (in relation to not doing any skiing/snowboarding activities)?\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

            "body": "I don't think it is too much moving around for a two-week trip, but people have different preferences about that kind of thing.  Personally, I am ok with shorter stays in order to see and do more, but plenty of people feel just the opposite.\n\nThe only thing I would add for Tokyo is a visit to Meiji Jingu shrine, which is easy to get to and right near Harajuku.  I have been many times, but still go again most of the time when I visit Tokyo because the grounds are quite beautiful.\n\nIf you feel that you have been moving around too much and don't want to be moving your stuff from hotel to hotel (or airbnb to airbnb) after Osaka/Kyoto/Nara, then I would do day trips from Tokyo on the back end rather than another location in Japan so you can avoid moving your luggage again.  For example, Karuizawa in Nagano is easily accessible, and even Nikko is a possible day trip, although a longer one.  I like having a few days in Tokyo at the back end of a Japan trip, especially if there are things I want to buy and bring back but don't want to lug around Japan, so if there are day trips that seem interesting to you, I would go for 3 or 4 days in Tokyo on the back end also.\n\nNot sure how you are getting from place to place.  I tend to agree with the camp that feels the all-encompassing JR pass is no longer worth it for most trips now that the price went up a lot, and while I have not priced out your particular itinerary, my sense is that it isn't better than buying individual tickets in your case either.  But if you do go with day trips from Tokyo on the back end of your trip, you might consider the JR Tokyo Wide Pass.  It is 15,000 yen, lasts for 3 days, and will get you to both Karuizawa and Nikko, as well as JR within Tokyo including to both Haneda and Narita (for Narita this is a real benefit, because I think it can be used on Narita Express, but for Haneda, which you are using, it is not a big deal because it is cheap to get to Haneda).  I have used that pass several times (although before it also went up in price).",
